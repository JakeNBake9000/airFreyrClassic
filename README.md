## Contributing

First off, I am in no way a programmer. I'm a groundskeeper who wanted to use his old iPod again. This is the product of a couple of weekends spent on StackOverflow to try to stick something together with tape and glue to download music that I have on CD, but I no longer have a CD drive to rip.

Feel free to make any changes you'd like! I've found that the search algorithm is unreliable in certain edge cases and tends to give music videos more often than it will give audio-only tracks. I am currently working on this. 

This version of the repository is the first version of the program that I got to work. It will take an Apple Music link, parse every song, download every song and album art, then encode the metadata. That's it. I don't plan to make any edits to this version as the readability and general cromulence of this program is poor / non-existent. But, if non-enhanced, non-programmer-brain, blue-collar-midwesterner code is your jam, here ya go. Knock yourself out! (A maintained version of this repository can be found at [zogdog9000/airFreyr](https://github.com/zogdog9000/airFreyr))

Thanks for taking the time to check out a lil' project by a crazy midwesterner. I hope you'll love breathing new life into your iPods like I did! Props to [miraclx for freyr-js, the inspiration / cause for this project!](https://github.com/miraclx/freyr-js)
